# Vue 2 Stencil Output Targets

This project was forked from [Stencils Vue Output targets](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-ds-output-targets/tree/master/packages/vue-output-target) in an effort to fully support Vue 2 for components built with `@stencil/core`

# Installation

```bash
npm install -D stencil-vue2-output-target

# OR

yarn add -D stencil-vue2-output-target
```

# Usage

## Vue

### Stencil Config setup

```ts
import { Config } from "@stencil/core";
import { vueOutputTarget } from "stencil-vue2-output-target";

export const config: Config = {
  namespace: "demo",
  outputTargets: [
    vueOutputTarget({
      componentCorePackage: "component-library",
      proxiesFile: "../component-library-vue/src/components.ts",
      componentModels: vueComponentModels,
    }),
    {
      type: "dist",
    },
  ],
};
```

#### componentCorePackage

This is the NPM package name of your core stencil package. In the case of Ionic we chose ‘@ionic/core’. This is the package that gets published that contains just your web components. This package is then used by the Vue package as a dependency

#### proxiesFile

This is the output file that gets generated by the outputTarget. This file should be referencing a different package location. In the example case we are choosing a sibling directory’s src directory. We will then create a Vue package that exports all components defined in this file.

### Setup of Vue Component Library

There is an example component library package available on Github so that you can get started. This repo will likely live as a sibling to your Stencil component library.

### Usage

```ts
import { DemoComponent } from "component-library-vue";
```
